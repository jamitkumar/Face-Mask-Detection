# Face-Mask-Detection
This project presents a simplified approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine Learning packages like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
The Face Mask Detection model is to detect the face of individuals and conclude whether they are wearing masks or not.
YOLO algorithm is used here that provides accurate results with minimal background errors.
